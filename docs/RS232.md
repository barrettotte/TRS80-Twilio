# RS232

From what I can see, this is the most straightforward way to communicate with a TRS-80.

## RS-232C Technical Description (from service manual)
The RS-232C circuit for the Model 4P computer supports asyn­chronous serial transmissions and conforms to the 
EIA RS-232C standards at the input-output interface connector (J4). The heart of the circuit is the TR1 865 
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter U30. It performs the job of converting the parallel byte data from the CPU 
to a serial data stream including start, stop, and parity bits. For a more detailed description of how this 
LSI circuit performs these functions, refer to the TR1 865 datasheets and application notes. The transmit and 
receive clock rates that the TR 1 865 needs are supplied by the Baud Rate Generator U52 (BR1 941 L) or (BR1 943). 
This circuit takes the 5.0688 MHz supplied by the system timing circuit and the pro­grammed information received 
from the CPU over the data bus and divides the basic clock rate to provide two clocks. The rates available from 
the BRG go from 50 Baud to 1 9200 Baud. See the BRG table for the complete list.


Interrupts are supported in the RS-232C circuit by the Interrupt mask register (U92) and the Status register (U44) which allow
the CPU to see which kind of interrupt has occurred. Interrupts can be generated on receiver data register full, 
transmitter reg­ister empty, and any one of the errors - parity, framing, or data overrun. This allows a minimum of CPU overhead
in transfer­ring data to or from the UART. The interrupt mask register is port EO (write) and the interrupt status register 
is port EO (read).

All Model I, III, and 4 software written for the RS-232-C interface is compatible with the Model 4P RS-232-C circuit, 
provided the software does not use the sense switches to configure the in­terface. The programmer can get around this 
problem by di­rectly programming the BRG and UART for the desired configuration or by using the SETCOM command of the disk
operating system to configure the interface . The TRS-80 RS-232C Interface hardware manual has a good discussion of the
RS-232C standard and specific programming examples (Cat­alog Number 26-1 1 45).
