# TRS80-4P

The original goal of this project was to receive data from my TRS-80 4P's RS232 interface and send a text message after data was received.

It involved either writing Z80 assembly or embedding machine code into BASIC.
As soon as I started actually making some ground one night I went to sleep.
The next morning I woke up horrified when I tried to boot up the model 4P.

It either had faulty RAM or my preboot floppy corrupted.
Either way, this project idea was killed just like that; I didn't have any time left to try repairing.
