# TRS80-4P

The original goal of this project was to receive data from TRS-80 4P's RS232 interface and send a text message after data was received.

It involved either writing Z80 assembly or embedding machine code into BASIC.
As soon as I started actually making some ground, I woke up horrified.

My model 4P either had faulty RAM or my preboot floppy corrupted.
Either way, this project approach was killed just like that.
